# Google Reviews Tab Implementation

## Overview

The Google Reviews tab has been successfully implemented in the review component. This feature allows users to view Google Reviews alongside existing Hostaway reviews in a tabbed interface.

## How It Works

### 1. Property Mapping
- Properties are mapped to Google Place IDs using the `PropertyMappingService`
- Mappings are stored in memory (can be extended to database storage)
- Automatic fallback search is available when mappings don't exist

### 2. Component Structure
```
Reviews.tsx
â””â”€â”€ EnhancedReviews.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ Hostaway Reviews Tab
    â””â”€â”€ Google Reviews Tab
        â””â”€â”€ GoogleReviews.tsx
```

### 3. Tab Interface
The review component now includes three tabs:
- **All Reviews**: Shows both Hostaway and Google reviews
- **Hostaway**: Shows only Hostaway reviews
- **Google**: Shows only Google reviews (when available)

## Features

### âœ… Implemented Features
- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean separation between review sources
- **Automatic Place ID Detection**: Searches for Google Place IDs when not mapped
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when Google Reviews are unavailable
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Mock Data Fallback**: Shows demo data when API is not configured

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Required
- Google Places API key in environment variables
- Property-to-Place ID mappings (can be managed via admin interface)

## Usage

### For Property Pages
The Google Reviews tab automatically appears when:
1. A property has a mapped Google Place ID, OR
2. The system can automatically find a Google Place ID for the property

### For Developers
```tsx
<Reviews 
  propertyId="155613"
  propertyName="The Bromley Collection"
  propertyAddress="4 Plymouth Rd, Bromley BR1 3JD, UK"
/>
```

## Property Mappings

### Current Mappings
The following properties have Google Reviews enabled:
- `155613` - The Bromley Collection
- `207762480` - The Peckham Apartments  
- `207762437` - Shoreditch Heights
- `207762440` - Camden Town Loft

### Adding New Mappings
1. Use the admin interface at `/admin/property-mappings`
2. Or add directly to the `sampleMappings` array in `lib/property-mapping.ts`

## API Integration

### Google Places API
- Fetches real Google Reviews when API key is configured
- Falls back to mock data when API is not available
- Handles rate limiting and error states

### Hostaway Integration
- Continues to work alongside Google Reviews
- Only shows published reviews (hidden reviews are filtered out)

## User Experience

### Tab Behavior
- **All Reviews**: Default view showing combined reviews
- **Hostaway**: Shows only property management system reviews
- **Google**: Shows only Google Reviews with rating and review count

### Loading States
- Shows "Loading..." in tab when searching for Google Place ID
- Displays skeleton loaders while fetching reviews
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files
- `components/Reviews.tsx` - Main review component
- `components/EnhancedReviews.tsx` - Tabbed interface
- `components/GoogleReviews.tsx` - Google Reviews display
- `lib/property-mapping.ts` - Property-to-Place ID mapping
- `lib/hooks/google-reviews/index.ts` - Google Reviews API hook

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Automatic place ID detection with fallback
- Loading states for better UX

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Database Storage**: Move mappings to database for persistence
2. **Auto-Search**: Automatically find and map properties to Google Places
3. **Review Analytics**: Combine metrics from both sources
4. **Review Response**: Allow responses to Google Reviews
5. **Review Filtering**: Filter by rating, date, language, etc.

### Admin Features
1. **Bulk Mapping**: Map multiple properties at once
2. **Mapping Validation**: Verify place IDs are valid
3. **Review Moderation**: Moderate Google Reviews before display
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track review performance across platforms

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to any property page (e.g., `/property/155613`)
2. Scroll to the Reviews section
3. Click on the "Google" tab
4. Verify Google Reviews are displayed

### Demo Data
When Google Places API is not configured, the system shows demo data with a clear indicator.

## Conclusion

The Google Reviews tab is fully functional and provides a seamless way to display Google Reviews alongside existing Hostaway reviews. The implementation is robust, user-friendly, and ready for production use.
