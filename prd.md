## 6. Narrative
Sarah, a Flex Living property manager, starts her Monday morning by opening the Reviews Dashboard. The homepage immediately shows her that Shoreditch Heights has dropped to 4.2 stars from 4.5 last monthâ€”a red flag that needs attention.

She clicks into the property detail view and filters for recent 1-2 star reviews. The pattern becomes clear: three guests in two weeks mentioned slow WiFi and noisy air conditioning. Sarah makes a note to schedule maintenance for both issues before they impact more bookings.

Next, she switches to her high-performing property in Camden. With a steady 4.8-star average and glowing feedback about the "amazing rooftop terrace" and "spotless modern kitchen," Sarah selects five recent reviews to feature on the property page. The preview shows exactly how guests will see them, maintaining Flex Living's clean aesthetic.

Before her coffee gets cold, Sarah has identified an urgent maintenance issue, updated public reviews to drive more bookings, and exported a trend report for her weekly team meeting. What used to take hours across multiple platforms now takes minutes in one unified dashboard.

Implementation Plan
1. Data Fetching & Integration
Use the uselistings hook to fetch all property listings, matching the structure in listings-data.json.
For reviews, use the API endpoint, but if it returns an empty array, fallback to the mock data in mock-data.json.
For single property details, use the listing ID from the listings data and fetch via the single listing API.
2. Dashboard UI
Build a modern, user-friendly dashboard interface strictly following the design inspiration (colors, spacing, fonts, card styles).
Main dashboard view:
Display a grid or table of properties, each showing key performance metrics (e.g., bookings, revenue, ratings, review count).
Each property card/row is clickable for detailed analytics.
3. Filtering & Sorting
Add filter controls above the property/review list:
Rating: Filter by average review rating or by specific category ratings (cleanliness, communication, etc.).
Category: Filter by review categories.
Channel: Filter by booking channel (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.).
Time: Filter by date range.
Add sorting options for rating, date, and other metrics.
Implement filtering and sorting logic client-side after fetching all data.
4. Trends & Recurring Issues
Aggregate review data by property, category, and time period (e.g., monthly averages).
Visualize trends using charts (line, bar, or area) for ratings and review counts over time.
Highlight recurring issues (e.g., consistently low scores, repeated negative comments) using color or icons.
Add a summary section listing top recurring issues or trends.
5. Review Selection for Public Website
Use MongoDB with Mongoose ODM to persist review visibility and admin acceptance.
Define a Mongoose schema for reviews, including:
All review fields from mock data
is_hidden (boolean) to indicate if a review is accepted for public display
Admins can toggle is_hidden in the dashboard.
On the property page, only display reviews where is_hidden is true.
6. Backend API
Create backend API endpoints to:
Fetch reviews (with is_hidden status)
Update review acceptance status (is_hidden)
Ensure endpoints are secure and only accessible to authorized admins.
7. Frontend Integration
Update dashboard UI to allow admins to accept/reject reviews for public display.
Sync review acceptance status with MongoDB via backend API.
Ensure real-time UI updates when review status changes.
8. Property Page
On the property details page, display only reviews accepted by admins (is_hidden: true).
9. General
Ensure all UI components strictly follow the design system.
Handle edge cases (e.g., missing data, API errors).
Document all code and logic for maintainability.
